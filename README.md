## Java Programming MOOC of Helsinki University

My solutions to the excellent course of the [Helsinki University's MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) teaching Java and algorithms.

All solutions got a pass from the automated corrector. However, although everything works, please be aware that not all code snippets are super-awesome-extra-perfect. 
On some occasions, the automated corrector wanted code to be a certain way (especially in the later chapters), on some others... it was just me who wanted to move on.

If you find some bugs and/or a much nicer solution, feel free to send a pull request.
