## Solutions to Java Programming MOOC of University of Helsinki

My solutions to the excellent [MOOC from the University of Helsinki](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) that teaches general Java, algorithms and object-oriented programming in Java. This repo holds the solutions to the exercises containing all 14 parts of both courses: *Java Programming I* and *Java Programming II*.

All my solutions passed both the local tests as well as the online grader. However, please be aware that although all files compile, work and are technically correct, **some solutions might not be the most efficient**. The grader sometimes checks for specific lines of code. Especially in the later exercises, the tests are a bit "finicky", requiring specific settings/commands to get the green pass.

**As such, please be note that these files should only be used for educational purposes.**

If you find bugs and/or better solutions, feel free to send a pull request.
